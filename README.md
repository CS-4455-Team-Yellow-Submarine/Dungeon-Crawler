#### How to Play

* Move the player character around using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
* Jump by hitting `SPACEBAR`.
* Push interactable objects around with `LEFTSHIFT`.
* Attack enemies by clicking `LEFTMOUSE`.

#### Technical Requirements

* `AI`: There is a skeleton enemy that patrols back and forth until the player character gets close enough. When the player character is close, the skeleton will walk toward the player character and begin attacking.
* `Physics`: There are boulders that the player character can push around to complete puzzles and move through rooms.
